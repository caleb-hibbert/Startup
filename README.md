# Web Chatting with Friends

[My Notes](notes.md)
The Web Chatting with Friends startup will allow users to log into a simple web chatting service through their browser where they can start or continue existing conversations with friends, family, and other aquantinces. It will provide a daily knock knock joke pulled from the Humor API to give users a casual way to reinitiate conversations if they ever need a hand getting talk started up again.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch
Web Chatting With Friends aims to provide a simple way to communicate with friends or family across devices! No need to download a hundred apps across different devices, no more waiting for updates to install before replying to someone, or discovering that your favorite app isn't compatible with your new phone or operating system - all you need is your browser, username, and password and you're good to go!

### Key features

- Users will create a username and password if they don't already have one, or log in using an existing username and password.
- The startup will provide daily knock knock jokes from the Humor API to help users start conversations back up that have gone stale.
- Users will be able to see and continue their previous chats if they log in using an existing username and password, previous chat contents persist between sessions.
- Users will be able to see the activity status of their friends, if they're active in the app or away.
  

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will be using two HTML pages for the login screen and for the chat screen. Friends and their status will be displayed on the left, with the current chat window in the center of the screen. Selecting another chat will cause the chat window to change to that of the selected person.
- **CSS** - The page will resize to correctly fit different screen sizes, to ensure elements are properly sized. The webpage will use proper style and formatting.
- **React** - Allow users to log in, send messages, see friend status, display text as it's typed and display it in the chat history once sent.
- **Service** - 
- **DB/Login** - Description here
- **WebSocket** - Description here
