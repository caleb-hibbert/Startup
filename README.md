### Elevator pitch
**Web Chat With Friends** aims to provide a simple way to communicate with friends or family across devices! No need to download a hundred apps across different devices, no more waiting for updates to install before replying to someone, or discovering that your favorite app isn't compatible with your new phone or operating system - all you need is your browser, username, and password and you're good to go!

### Key features

- Users will create a username and password if they don't already have one, or log in using an existing username and password.
- The startup will provide daily knock knock jokes from the Humor API to help users start conversations back up that have gone stale.
- Users will be able to see and continue their previous chats if they log in using an existing username and password, previous chat contents persist between sessions.
- Users will be able to see the activity status of their friends, if they're active in the app or away.
  

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will be using two HTML pages for the login screen and for the chat screen. Friends and their status will be displayed on the left, with the current chat window in the center of the screen. Selecting another chat will cause the chat window to change to that of the selected person.
- **CSS** - The page will resize to correctly fit different screen sizes, to ensure elements are properly sized. The webpage will use proper style and formatting.
- **React** - Allow users to log in, send messages, see friend status, display text as it's typed and display it in the chat history once sent.
- **Service** - The application will retreive login information, friends list, and chat history. It will retreive the daily knock knock joke from the Humor API.
- **DB/Login** - Stores users, friend association, and chat history in a database. Users won't be able to send or receive messages until logged in with a valid account. Welcome message placeholder added that displays user's username at the top of the chat page.
- **WebSocket** - When a user sends a message, their active status will be enabled be visible to those on their friends list. Sending a message to a friend will update their page to display its contents.
